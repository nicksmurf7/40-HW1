Correctly implemented aspects of our programs:
    - Brightness works! We hope! Even though u can't see it on Git!
    - Simlines looks lit as hell rn, except for these big memory leaks

Incorrectly implemented aspects of our programs:
    - Readaline doesn't apply "If readaline is called when there are no more lines to be read, 
        it sets *datapp to NULL and returns 0.
